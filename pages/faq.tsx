      {description: 'Which version of iOS does this support?', answer: 'Importing the new enhanced QR codes into Apple Wallet requires iOS 15+, for everyone elase please create Photo cards'},
      {description: 'I\'m having issues with adding a Wallet card to my older iPhone', answer: 'Unfortunately, the minimum requirement for importing the new QR code int Apple Wallet is iOS 15, which runs on iPhone 6s and newer devices - you will need to create a Photo card'},
      {description: "What are the supported browsers?", answer: 'For iPhones, only Safari is supported for importing to your Apple Wallet. For any other devices, we recommend that you save it as photo using an updated Google Chrome. Browsers built internally into mobile apps (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) are known to have issues.'},
      {description: "How is my private information handled?", answer: 'Your proof-of-vaccination PDF (and most of the information in it) never leaves your device, and does NOT get sent to our server - the only information we send and store is non-personally-identifiable information such as vaccine type, date, and which organization gave you the vaccine. We share your concern about personal data being stored and lost, which is why we chose not to store or send any of it to our servers so there is no chance of it being lost or leaked.'},
      {description: 'Can you tell me about Android support?', answer: 'We are working with Google to gain access to the Google Pay COVID card APIs required to make Apple Wallet-equivalent passes for Android. Meanwhile, you can save a Photo card, or use our site to download an Apple Wallet pass and import that into Google Pay Wallet using apps such as Pass2Pay.'},
      {description: 'I have a Red/White OHIP card. Can I still use this tool?', answer: 'Yes you can! Just call the Provincial Vaccine Contact Centre at 1-833-943-3900. The call centre agent can email you a copy of the receipt.'},
      {description: 'I do not have a health card. Can I still use this tool?', answer: 'First contact your local public health unit to verify your identity and receive a COVIDcovid ID/Personal Access Code. You can then call the Provincial Vaccine Contact Centre at 1-833-943-3900 to get an email copy of your receipt.'},
      {description: 'Why isn\'t the new Apple Wallet pass green/orange?', answer: 'Because we now allow importing of QR codes from many provinces and states, and those provinces and states have different eligibility rules, we can no longer reliably determine who is or is not valid at receipt import time.'},
      {description: 'How is the data on my vaccination receipt processed?', answer: 'Inside your local web browser, it checks the uploaded PDF or image for a valid QR code. If present, the QR code is converted and either added to Apple Waller or created as a photo depending on the option you choose.'},
      {description: 'How can organizations validate this QR code?', answer: 'Verify Ontario app is your official tool. For devices that cannot run the official tool, you can also use our web-based tool at verifier.vaccine-ontario.ca, once we have added support for verifying the new QR codes to it (work is in progress right now)'},
      {description: 'Can I use the same iPhone to store passes for my entire family?', answer: 'Yes. You can save multiple Wallet or Photo cards on your device without issue.'},
      {description: 'Is this free and non-commercial?', answer: 'Similar to VaxHuntersCanada, there are no commercial interests. Just volunteers trying to do our part to help the community.'},
      {description: 'How about support for other provinces?', answer: 'We now have support for Ontario, British Columbia, Qu√©bec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Yukon, California, New York, and Louisiana QR codes. If you have a QR code that is not currently supported by our app, please contact us at grassroots@vaccine-ontario.ca'},
      {description: 'How about Apple Watch?', answer: 'If you have iCloud sync enabled, you will see the pass on the watch too.'},
      {description: 'Why have we taken time to build this?', answer: 'We wanted to give people across Canada the ability to conveniently and securely add their vaccination QR code to their mobile devices to make it easier to present them, and also wanted to create a verifier tool which requires no app install and is convenient for anyone to use from a web browser on any device with a camera.'},
      {description: 'Who made this?', answer: 'The same group of volunteers who created the all-in-one vaccine appointment finding tool at vaccine-ontario.ca'},
      {description: 'How can I stay up-to-date on your progress?', answer: 'We will post regular updates on Twitter @grassroots_team'},
      {description: 'I have more questions. Can you please help me?', answer: 'Sure. Just email us at grassroots@vaccine-ontario.ca'}
